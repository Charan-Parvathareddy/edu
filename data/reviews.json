    "message": "I want to share my recent experience with Edubridge’s Advanced Data Analytics course to warn others about potential pitfalls. I enrolled in this 10-month program with high expectations, believing the promises of valuable skills and job placement opportunities.\n\nThe course was marketed with a commitment to provide job opportunities starting from the 4th month, with a guaranteed placement by the end. Despite completing the course successfully (I earned an 'A' grade) and making considerable efforts, it has now been 9 months since graduation, and I have not received any job opportunities.\n\nWhat’s even more troubling is the lack of response from Edubridge when I raised these concerns. Their failure to address the issue or communicate effectively has been deeply disappointing and has led me to believe that I have been misled.\n\nI’m sharing this to warn others who might be considering this course. My experience suggests that the promises made by Edubridge may not be reliable. Be cautious and thoroughly research before committing to any program that makes grand claims about job placements and guarantees.\n\nI hope this helps others avoid similar disappointments and encourages prospective students to seek out more transparent and trustworthy education providers.\n\nStay informed and stay cautious!\n\n"
